# User scenarios

These statuses describe the historical upstream requirements catalog, not tools included in this preview. The public pack can advise from supplied evidence; it cannot execute these workflows.

- `AVAILABLE_NOW`: a verified narrow upstream capability existed.
- `PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE`: useful pieces existed, with explicit end-to-end gaps.
- `PLANNED`: a product goal without a completed workflow.
- `FUTURE_VISION`: depended on later interfaces, hardware, history or multimodal development.

Full output reconstruction, arbitrary rewiring, automatic annotation review, comparative deployment, reconnect/freshness orchestration, voice/visual grounding and durable multi-camera history remain incomplete goals. Narrow atomic evidence does not establish a complete scenario. See [Capabilities](CAPABILITIES.md).

## Representative advisory workflows

| Scenario | Sanitized prerequisite | Useful public output | Remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| US-03 Explain a project | Exact version and supplied FLOW/Code/result description | Execution and decision map with unknowns | Supplied inventory alone does not reconstruct all outputs or persistent state |
| US-05 Capture images | Selected ready project and camera; capture policy | Checklist for a bounded image set and identity/readback | Historical 4.0.3 capture evidence does not provide a public capture tool |
| US-08 Bootstrap Detector | Reviewed seed labels and original image basis | Seed/geometry/training/artifact checklist | Full automatic review, retraining and comparison loop remains partial |
| US-12 Smart Mask proposal | Target and reviewed proposal geometry | Explain suggestion versus accepted annotation | Suggestion is not a persisted annotation or an accuracy guarantee |
| US-23 Explain unexpected NOK | Matched image, evaluated results and acceptance rule | Evidence-based hypothesis and smallest discriminating check | A screenshot or static module list cannot establish the full decision path |
| US-34 External sensor Gate | Exact device data, units, identity and freshness rules | PEKAT integration design with invalid/stale handling | Complete sensor-to-Gate execution is planned, not provided |
| US-41 Python compatibility | Exact embedded build, ABI and candidate package | Compatibility assessment and bounded import-test proposal | Arbitrary package installation is not automated |

Version scope: source catalog snapshot with narrow historical 4.0.3 evidence.
Evidence level: reconciled requirements and curated capability conclusions.
Known limitations: catalog statuses are historical upstream statuses; this public
preview provides advice rather than executing those workflows.
